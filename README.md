## AWS Lambda x MongoDB

For our generalize hotel management this repository contains backend infrastructure deployed with AWS MongoDB, AWS Lambda, AWS S3 (alternative) and sooner we will use AWS SNS or AWS SQS if applicable sooner.

Language: JavaScript

## Existing project (Unfinished god damn haha)
It has a terrible bad security measure anyway.

- For desktop-based version [see our desktop.](https://github.com/itgauy/GEN-HOTEL-VB)
- For web-based version [see our desktop.](https://github.com/itgauy/GEN-HOTEL-REACT)

## How to install and run?

```powershell
yarn install
```

Or you can use other package managers just make sure that AWS Lambda had official support.

```powershell
serverless offline
```
