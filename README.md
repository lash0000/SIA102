## AWS MongoDB Infrastructure

For our generalize hotel management this repository contains backend infrastructure deployed with AWS Lambda, AWS S3 (alternative) and sooner we will use AWS SNS or AWS SQS if applicable sooner

Language: JavaScript

## How to install and run?

```powershell
npm install --force
```

It's stupid due to conflicts between serverless-http (3.2.0) and serverless (14.0x)

```powershell
serverless offline
```
